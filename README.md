# CodeAlpha_Secure_Coding_Review

## Introduction
Welcome to the CodeAlpha_Secure_Coding_Review repository! This repository contains the PDF report detailing the vulnerability assessments of the web application named DefenselessV1, along with secure coding recommendations. The assessments were conducted using Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), and Penetration Testing techniques. These assessments were part of the tasks assigned during the Code Alpha Internship program to enhance understanding of Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) techniques and reports.
